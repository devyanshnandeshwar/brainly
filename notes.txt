2. Whenever you create a high-level project in TypeScript, make sure that you create a declaration file .d.ts. Why?
Because we are importing express, which is based on JavaScript and does not contain types. Since we are making a TypeScript project, this will throw an error when we import it. Declaration files never run when you are running your final JavaScript code. Dev dependency means it is being used during development only, not in production. Whenever you publish a TypeScript project, you publish a .d.ts file, not the .ts file. You will not be able to use the power of typescript unless you provide it with declaration files.
